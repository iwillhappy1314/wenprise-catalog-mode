# WooCommerce Catalogue Mode
WooCommerce catalogue mode is a lightweight Wordpress plugin that removes price, cart and checkout functionality from WooCommerce to turn it into a product catalogue - a website used mainly for displaying products. 

This plugin will take care of the following:
- Remove all prices from the WooCommerce front end
- Remove all "Add to Cart" buttons from the front end
- Disable access to the Cart page
- Disable access to the Checkout page

No additional configuration is required, just install, activate and use your WooCommerce catalogue.
